title: Book Summary: Principles of Product Management
---

So one of the things I really wanted to achieve with writing posts was to really learn how to properly articulate my thoughts and also to provide a space that I can catalogue my learnings and thoughts as I progress. One of the things I really wish to start keeping track of is some of the books I've been reading and the pearls of wisdom and things that crop up in them.

This leads to the following post, I wanted to start writing book summaries when I finish a book to try and recap the fundamental teaching of the book and distill the information down into a blog post. The latest book that I wanted to write a summary about I stumbled upon through a retweet

One of my colleagues was talking about Product Management as a potential career path and I wanted to learn a bit more about the space, this retweet popped up at just the right time and the price is super affordable so I jumped on the opportunity straight away!

## Part 1: Product Management Principles

The first part of the book attempts to break down the principles that Peter things every Product Manager should embody to really lead their team and drive best outcomes for their product.

The principles can be broke down into the following:
1. _Take Ownership:_ It's about owning mistakes and owning the results of your product. If the products does well, it's easy to pass the blame but doing so will not garner results. He suggests three areas you must focus on owning and they are; being humble and not trying to pass the blame. Owning your negative emotions and controlling them, acknowledging that they happen but knowing that you're attitude can really turn the team around so keeping your emotions in check. Taking ownership of your relationships! Seeking out mentors and maintaining healthy relationships with your stakeholders.

2. _Prioritize and Execute:_ "It's better to achieve a breakthrough in a single goal than to pursue multiple goals at once". That line sums up this principle. Focus on a small set of goals you know you can achieve, communicate these goals so that your peers know where your focus lies. Last of all, stop at nothing to execute these goals as the reduced priorities means you can dedicate your time more efficiently and deeply.

3. _Start with Why:_ When leading teams it's often hard to get everyone aligned. Telling someone what they have to do often leads to friction if they do not understand the why they are doing it. Obsess over the customs problem, communicate it effectively to your team and make sure the why is simply explained and understood.

4. _Find the Truth:_ I found this one resonated with me. Label yourself as a truth seeker, not as a always being right. This applies not only to product management but in general. As a developer sometimes my code is up for review, if I receive negative feedback I find myself defending my code sometimes in spite of knowing that it is incorrect. Understanding that you value the truth above all things means you are able to back down if the truth is not your code and really prioritising finding the truth above all.

5. _Be Radically Transparent:_ Care personally about other people's success. Challenge directly and provide constructive feedback by delivering feedback as fast as possible with specific examples. Empower others to make decisions, as part of being a great product manager is the success of your team when you are not present.

6. _Be Honest with Yourself:_ Set clear long-term goals with clear success criteria. Reflect often on your success, failures so that you can identify your strengths and weaknesses. Constantly seek feedback from others to constantly be improving your own weaknesses and hopefully empowering others.
