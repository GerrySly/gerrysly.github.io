title: Book Summary: Principles of Product Management
Category: Book Summary

So one of the things I really wanted to achieve with writing posts was to really learn how to properly articulate my thoughts and also to provide a space that I can catalogue my learnings and thoughts as I progress. One of the things I really wish to start keeping track of is some of the books I've been reading and the pearls of wisdom and things that crop up in them.

This leads to the following post, I wanted to start writing book summaries when I finish a book to try and recap the fundamental teaching of the book and distill the information down into a blog post. The latest book that I wanted to write a summary about I stumbled upon through a retweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ“–ðŸŽ‰ I&#39;m excited to share that my book, Principles of Product Management, is now available on Amazon - <a href="https://t.co/UAquvNiwBY">https://t.co/UAquvNiwBY</a>. <br><br>Hereâ€™s what the book is about ðŸ‘‡ <a href="https://t.co/S5qdC6PgBy">pic.twitter.com/S5qdC6PgBy</a></p>&mdash; Peter Yang (@petergyang) <a href="https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1216418134527115264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One of my colleagues was talking about Product Management as a potential career path and I wanted to learn a bit more about the space, this retweet popped up at just the right time and the price is super affordable so I jumped on the opportunity straight away!

## Part 1: Product Management Principles

The first part of the book attempts to break down the principles that Peter things every Product Manager should embody to really lead their team and drive best outcomes for their product.

The principles can be broke down into the following:
1. _Take Ownership:_ It's about owning mistakes and owning the results of your product. If the products does well, it's easy to pass the blame but doing so will not garner results. He suggests three areas you must focus on owning and they are; being humble and not trying to pass the blame. Owning your negative emotions and controlling them, acknowledging that they happen but knowing that you're attitude can really turn the team around so keeping your emotions in check. Taking ownership of your relationships! Seeking out mentors and maintaining healthy relationships with your stakeholders.

2. _Prioritize and Execute:_ "It's better to achieve a breakthrough in a single goal than to pursue multiple goals at once". That line sums up this principle. Focus on a small set of goals you know you can achieve, communicate these goals so that your peers know where your focus lies. Last of all, stop at nothing to execute these goals as the reduced priorities means you can dedicate your time more efficiently and deeply.

3. _Start with Why:_ When leading teams it's often hard to get everyone aligned. Telling someone what they have to do often leads to friction if they do not understand the why they are doing it. Obsess over the customs problem, communicate it effectively to your team and make sure the why is simply explained and understood.

4. _Find the Truth:_ I found this one resonated with me. Label yourself as a truth seeker, not as a always being right. This applies not only to product management but in general. As a developer sometimes my code is up for review, if I receive negative feedback I find myself defending my code sometimes in spite of knowing that it is incorrect. Understanding that you value the truth above all things means you are able to back down if the truth is not your code and really prioritising finding the truth above all.

5. _Be Radically Transparent:_ Care personally about other people's success. Challenge directly and provide constructive feedback by delivering feedback as fast as possible with specific examples. Empower others to make decisions, as part of being a great product manager is the success of your team when you are not present.

6. _Be Honest with Yourself:_ Set clear long-term goals with clear success criteria. Reflect often on your success, failures so that you can identify your strengths and weaknesses. Constantly seek feedback from others to constantly be improving your own weaknesses and hopefully empowering others.

## Part 2: Product Management Loop in Detail

![Product Management Loop in Detail](/public/product-management-loop.png)

This chapter started to focus more on the actual day to day working of a product manager. The loop above is how the chapter is laid out and how I'll title my next subsections

### Understand & Identify

The first thing a product manager should do is __understand the customers problem__. This should be at the heart of everything you do and in the process of understanding their problem you can further understand why the problem exists and the criticality behind solving this problem. The famous quote by Amazon found Jess Bezos is used to highlight this customer obsession

> The #1 thing that has made us successful by far is an obsessive-compulsive focus on the customer as opposed to the competitor.

One you have a good understanding of the customer problem, you need to be able to quantify your products success and this can be done by __setting a goal metric__. The key here is finding a metric that is easy to understand and measure _AND_ that your team can directly grow. There is no point picking a convoluted metric that you have no direct way of influencing only to have your product crash and burn when released.

Understanding and identifying the mission, vision and strategy for your team is the next key step that Peter highlights. He breaks the 3 down as following:

> __Mission__ is why your team exists. It's the big, audacious goal that inspires your team to succeed.
> __Vision__ is what the world will look like once you make significant progress towards your mission.
> __Strategy__ is how your team will achieve your mission and vision.

He then goes on to say that a great mission and vision solves a real customer problem, inspires your team and helps people makes decisions. Peter then backs this up by paraphrasing _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy_ written by Richard Rumelt saying a good strategy has three components

> 1. A diagnosis of the major challenges that are preventing you from achieving your mission
> 2. An overarching plan to overcome these challenges
> 3. A set of actions to accomplish the plan

Peter moves onto the building of a product roadmap. This chapter delves into [OKR's](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) and how to define them and align them with your previously set Mission, Vision and Strategy. One of the things that Peter also touches on was making sure to set achievable but also stretch OKR's to avoid team disillusionment.

What I would consider the final part of the Understand & Identify section is the __defining of the product requirements__. Peter has been a member of the Amazon product management team so if anyone has worked with Amazon (or read anything online) they like to tout this "press release" way of dealing with products. The premise is viewing the product from launch day and writing a press release for your customers. This allows you to really focus on the first part of this section and that is obsessing over the customers problem. How does this product solve it and can you distill your overarching plan defined by your strategy into simple terms that really highlight how the product will help the customer.

## Execute

I'm going to be fairly brief on this section as Peter starts to delve into the actual execution bits of product managers that really relate to project management. The first section lists the 4 parts of the project that you should be following (Kick-Off, Dogfood, Launch, Retro) and some information surrounding them. 

After that he moves into effective communication which shows generally some tips on writing more concisely and with purpose. The next part of effective communication centres around the ceremonies and meetings that you should be religious in upholding to maintain your teams velocity and open line of communication. Finally he closes the section on tips for running effective meetings.

1. Focus on the "why" first
2. Have a mindset of "how can I help you"
3. Have an agenda
4. Keep meetings focused
5. Send notes right after the meeting

The final section for execution is around making good decisions. The nugget of wisdom I got out of this section was the concept of one-way and two-way door decisions. It's to first identify if it's a one-way or two-way decision, this analogy explains the ability for you to back out of the decision if it is wrong. One-way is virtually impossible to go back on and two-way gives you the ability to back it out with relative ease. Once you can identify the sort of decision it is, you must spend more time making a good decision on a one-way than a two-way. 

## Part 3: Getting the Job

I'm going to leave notes out of this section as Peter really goes into a lot of examples of interviews and how to get the most out of the job once you get the job. Some notes I did like about finding the right fit company (as it does hold true for not only product managers) were centered around the types of companies that are out there.

__Market Leader:__ These are your big companies (think Google, Facebook, Amazon) and they provide you with tons and tons of experience and fantastic mentors. If you are just starting out these are the recommended point of entry as you can learn a lot of best practices from some of the best in the business. The only downside is also what makes them great, the size of these companies means you don't really influence the direction and your role is highly specific. 

__High-Growth:__ These companies have a strong product-market fit and are rapidly growing. These companies can see you move very quickly and can be fantastic to really make your mark. This company can be a luck of the draw but by and large you won't have mentors and people to learn from, this company fit would be great for a mid to senior level (I was looking at these from the engineer / developer lens)

__Turnaround:__ These companies have found their product-market fit but are not growing. They're aiming to turn it around through either pivoting or launching new intitiates to move it into another segment of company type (high-growth). The tricky part here is identifying if they're actually a turnaround or not. They could very well be a sinking ship and you jumping on board sinks with it.

__Early-stage:__ These companies don't have a product-market fit, this is a similar gamble as a turnaround company. If the idea is right or they have the right people are the helm, they could very easily turn into a high-growth company. Once again, however, you typically won't have a large continent of people to learn from and are usually expected to be the knowledge beacon from early on.

That's it! I'm going to try and summarise (though this was horrendously long) all of my readings from now on! I'm currently reading Superforecasting on a recommendation from a friend so hopefully that will be my next book summary.
