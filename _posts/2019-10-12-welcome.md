This post will be short and sweet as it's basically just a placeholder to validate the blog works! Welcome to my blog, where I'll post some of my ramblings and random tidbits
typically around computer science and technology.

A little about me, I'm an Engineer who's interest (like a lot of people I assume) currently span multiple disciplines having worked on frontend, backend and played with some
infrastructure throughout my tenure.

I'd like this blog to kind of serve as a platform for consolidating some of my thoughts, improving some of my writing style and also generally giving me a platform to interact
with the industry.
