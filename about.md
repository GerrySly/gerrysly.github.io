I am a 20 nearly 30 something software engineer from Melbourne, Australia.

I enjoy all there is when it comes to Computer Science and want to use this blog as somewhere to document my learnings and generally random information I want to catalogue.

I find it hard to succinctly and coherently describe my thoughts so having to sit down and write a blog post gives me that discipline. Not only that but in the process of writing the blog posts I find I further enhance my knowledge on the topic.
